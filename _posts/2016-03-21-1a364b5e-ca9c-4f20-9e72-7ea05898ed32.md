_A sales rep in a smart grey suit, carrying a briefcase full of catalogues. That's not the image that comes to mind when you hear the word '22nd century selling', is it? A salesperson with a tablet then? Neither! It's time to face the new reality: with today's globalization and the rise of the internet, traditional sales is dead. And yet there is still a bright future for sales. The name of the game? Value co-creation!_

Does your sales team still talk about customers as 'targets', whom they have to 'persuade' and make promises to? Today's digital, demanding customers expect more than that! As they can find information, compare products, ask questions and buy online, today's consumers are no longer waiting for a salesperson to 'persuade' them. So how can companies make a real difference, win their customers' hearts and gain an edge over their competitors? By providing their customers with true added value! 

**_So what is true added value?_**

True added value is not inherent to your products or services. It is the value that your customer experiences when he uses or consumes your offering, i.e. how it helps him 'get the job done'. Hence the importance of co-creation: only through real dialogue with customers, can sellers understand how their product offering can help clients improve their performance or can they develop -- co-create -- solutions.

**_Collaborate to co-create_**

In other words, the very core of co-creation is collaboration. You consider your clients as partners with whom you get around the table to discuss business opportunities, explore new markets and think up new products. More than promising an outcome, you'll deliver a solution or service that will really help your customer move forward. In this way, you're building a unique partnership that fosters customer loyalty. You don't_sell_any products or solution, yet your customers are happy to buy from you. They might even pay you for the consultancy you offered...

**_From \`spark centers' ..._**

A few examples? IT expert CGI regularly invites its customers to its 'spark centers', where it showcases all the latest technology gadgets, like wearables, sensors, etc. After the visits -- which the customers adore! --, customers and experts brainstorm about how the solutions they explored could help them take their business to the next level. SAP, by the way, is doing something similar in its co-innovation labs, where its ecosystem of partners, customers, universities, etc. joins forces to create innovative solutions that help SAP achieve its mission: 'help businesses run simpler'.

**_... to Chocolate Academies!_**

For those of you who think that co-creation only matches the bill of hi-tech or services companies: chocolate giant Callebaut does it too!  Worldwide, the famous chocolate and cocoa manufacturer operates over 20 Chocolate Academies(tm) where chocolate professionals are welcome to develop their skills, learn about trends, new techniques, new tastes and exchange ideas.
